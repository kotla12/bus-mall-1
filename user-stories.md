1. As a user, I want to see three photos so that I can choose one
2. As a user, I want to get a new set of photos after I choose one, and I don't want duplicate photos directly after I have chosen one
3. As a user, I would like to have an easy to understand interface so that I know exactly what to do
4. As a developer, I would like to use a constructor function to create all of my photo objects and store them in an array for convenience
5. As a developer, I want to my page to be easy to understand and interact with
6. As a developer, I want to generate three random pictures for my user to choose from and then generate a new set of images after a previous one has been clicked, without getting any repeats
7. As a developer, I want to store the data from the users clicks and display it after 25 clicks have been made. I should display the total clicks as well as a percentage of how often it was clicked.
