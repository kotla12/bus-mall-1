# bus-mall

The bus mall website shows a user pictures of potential products and gets their feedback on what they would like to by. It shows them sets of pictures, three at a time, and asks them to click on whichever item they like the best. We use this data to display a graph of their choices, how many times an image was showed to them and how many times it was clicked on. This data will be used in the future to help the bus mall company decide what products would sell the best based on the user feedback that we generate.
